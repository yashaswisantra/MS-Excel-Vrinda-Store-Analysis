# MS-Excel-Vrinda-Store-Analysis

Here I have tried to do a Vrinda store analysis by applying some pie, bar and combo charts and tried to show the relationship between order and sales and age and gender. Also shown the percentage of order status and channels. I added some slicer to make the analysis easy.

Based on the Vrinda Store Annual Report 2022, here are some key insights:

1) Sales and Order Trends: Sales peaked in February and generally declined throughout the year. The number of orders followed a similar trend, with the highest in early months.
2) Customer Demographics: Women make up the majority (64%) of sales compared to men (36%). Adult women are the largest customer segment, followed by teenage women.
3) Top Performing States: Maharashtra leads in sales (2.99M), followed by Karnataka (2.65M) and Uttar Pradesh (2.10M).
4) Order Fulfillment: 92% of orders were successfully delivered. Only 2% were refunded, 3% returned, and 3% cancelled.
5) Sales Channels: Amazon is the dominant channel (35% of orders), followed by Myntra (23%) and Flipkart (22%).
6) Product Categories: While specific category performance isn't shown, the store offers various products including sarees, sets, tops, and western dresses.

These insights suggest that Vrinda Store has a strong female customer base, good order fulfillment rates, and relies heavily on e-commerce platforms for sales. There's potential to improve sales in the latter half of the year and expand in states beyond the top performers.
